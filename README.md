----------
Our project contains 2 possible material types. Matte, which is completely lambertian, and BlinnPhong, which is a combination of both siffusive and specular factors. 
4 types of light sources have been implemented, PointLight, SpotLight, Ambient, DirectionalLight.
We have two ray tracers, one which is a basic ray tracer and one which implements shadows, the ImprovedTracer.
We have functionality to import meshes from .ply files. Note: Pls specify the entire address of your file. You will have to alter the viewplane and camera yourself.
